	<h4>I chose the media major course LSC 432 in the fall semester of the 2023 academic year. Our group project for this class was "Billie's Soap." This brand produces natural bath, cleaning and personal products. Our team's project content is to help them expand their markets, create better turnover, and help them better operate online social media. They use organic ingredients at affordable prices, giving their products a solid foundation. Our team helped them redesign the layout of their website and the operation of their Instagram and Twitter official accounts. We also try to let them use live broadcasts to sell goods online in order to obtain higher sales.

	<h4>Another option is my own brand that I started running last year. All product production, creativity, social media operations, including marketing, are done independently by me. At the beginning of this project, I discovered the demand among girls in the United States for beautiful nails and some fine jewelry. Press-on Nail is good and cheap. For the price of an ordinary manicure, you can have more than 5 exquisite styles of Press-on Nail. I shot and recorded a lot of videos and photos showing the styles of Press-on Nail I wanted to sell, and also live-streamed on my own Chinese social media accounts.
