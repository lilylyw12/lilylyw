	<h2>About me:</h2>
	
	<p>
		I am a Chinese girl born in Zhengzhou, Henan. I am an only child, and my parents have been very good to me. The relationship between our family is very harmonious. Leaving my distant motherland and coming to the United States to study is the most regrettable thing I have ever done in my life. Although I have always missed my parents, I feel that the knowledge, understanding, and abilities I learned at the University of Wisconsin-Madison will benefit me throughout my life. After graduation, I will choose to return to my hometown to accompany my parents. Temporarily think of the blogger from the media, and might still want to do business in a few years.
